<p><strong>Demand Estimation with Zeros: Moving Costs in the US</strong> <br />
<em>Abstract</em>: This paper develops a flexible discrete-choice demand framework for
aggregate data sets that extends Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) and the
Pure Characteristics Demand Model of Berry and Pakes (2007). The framework
accommodates zero market shares, which are a challenge for alternative
approaches. I show that zeros in demand generate an endogenously censored
model, which leads to moment inequalities. I provide a simple, computationally
tractable, asymptotically normal estimator based on two contributions: a
globally-convergent algorithm to recover utilities from observed demand and a
Quasi-Bayes approach that minimizes simulation variance. As an application, I
study moving costs and housing policies on US internal migration data. Moving
costs are high and highly variable, which implies substantial benefits from
targeted housing policies.</p>

<p><strong>Counterfactual Analysis for Structural Dynamic Discrete Choice Models</strong> <br />
With Myrto Kalouptsidi, Yuichi Kitamura, and Eduardo Souza-Rodrigues <br />
<em>Abstract</em>: Discrete choice data allow researchers to recover differences in utilities, but these differences may not
suffice to identify policy-relevant counterfactuals of interest. In fact, in the case of dynamic discrete
choice models, only a narrow set of counterfactuals are point-identified. In this paper, we explore
how much one can learn about counterfactual outcomes of interest within this framework. We focus
on the partial identification of counterfactuals, while allowing for (mild) model restrictions that can
gradually shrink the identified set. We derive bounds for low-dimensional objects (such as average
welfare) as arguments of optimization programs, along with a uniformly valid inference procedure.
Furthermore, we develop new and tractable computational tools and algorithms suitable for dealing
with high-dimensional problems like this. Finally, we illustrate in Monte Carlos, as well as an empirical
exercise of firmsâ€™ export decisions, the informativeness of the identified sets, and we assess the impact
of (common) model restrictions on results.</p>
